        thanks for stopping by ☺️<br>
      
        here&#39;s a bit about me:<br>
      
    </h2>
    
      <p>I graduated in April of 2021 from Columbia Engineering, where I received my B.S. in Computer Science on the Vision, Graphics, Interaction, &amp; Robotics track. I also minored in Sociology. 🎓📚</p>
    
      <p>While a student, I diversifed my tech-heavy courseload with sociology, sustainable development, and manufacturing design courses. Outside of the classroom, I spent my time helping fellow students in my job as a TA, tinkering in our Makerspaces, and trying new sweets 🍪 around the Big Apple. 🍎</p>
    
      <p>I&#39;m currently recovering from U.S. Open ballperson tryout rejection 🥺🎾 by planning a celebratory train ride across the U.S. once it&#39;s safe 🚞. Meanwhile, I hope to find work that utilizes + builds upon my skills and interests while helping make this 🌎 a safer, greener, more equitible place. Some of my current interests include: sustainability, baking, Thai food, reading, running, and crosswords.</p>
    
      <p>Here on my website you can find a few of my featured projects. Please have a look around and drop me a line if you&#39;d like to chat!</p>
