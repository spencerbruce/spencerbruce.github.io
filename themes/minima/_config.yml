  - "thanks for stopping by!"
  - "here's a bit about me:"
desc: 
  - "I am a recent graduate from Columbia University, where I recieved a B.S. in Computer Science on the Vision, Graphics, Interaction, & Robotics track."
  - "While a student, I had loads of fun exploring the creative process and diversified my courseload with sociology, sustainability, and manufacturing courses. Outside of the classroom, I filled my time mentoring students in my job as a TA, tinkering in our Makerspaces, and trying new sweets around the Big Apple."
  - "My interests bring me too many niche topics to count, but some of my current favorites include: sustainability, crafting, baking, Thai food, reading, and running."
subdesc: "Here on my website you can find a few of my featured projects. Please have a look around and drop me a line if you'd like to collaborate!"
