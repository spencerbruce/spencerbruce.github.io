  - "here's a bit about me:"
desc: 
  - "I graduated in April of 2021 from Columbia Engineering, where I received my B.S. in Computer Science on the Vision, Graphics, Interaction, & Robotics track. I also minored in Sociology! üéìüìö"
  - "While a student, I diversifed my tech-heavy courseload with sociology, sustainable development, and manufacturing design courses. Outside of the classroom, I spent my time helping fellow students in my job as a TA, tinkering in our Makerspaces, and trying new sweets üç™ around the Big Apple. üçé"
  - "I'm currently recovering from U.S. Open ballperson tryout rejection ü•∫üéæ by planning a celebratory train ride across the U.S. once it's safe üöû. Meanwhile, I hope to find work that utilizes + builds upon my skills and interests to help make this üåé a safer, more equitible place. Some of my current interests include: sustainability, baking, Thai food, reading, running, and crosswords."
