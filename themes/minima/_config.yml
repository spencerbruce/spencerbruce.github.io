#description
desc: ["I am a recent graduate from Columbia University, where I recieved a B.S. in Computer Science on the Vision, Graphics, Interaction, & Robotics track.","While a student, I had loads of fun exploring the creative process and diversified my courseload with sociology, sustainability, and manufacturing courses. Outside of the classroom, I filled my time mentoring students in my job as a TA, tinkering in our Makerspaces, and trying new sweets around the Big Apple.", "My interests bring me to too many niche topics to count, but some of my current favorites include: sustainability, crafting, baking, Thai food, reading, and running."]
subdesc: "Here on my website you can find a few of my featured projects. Please have a look around and drop me a line if you'd like to collaborate!"
