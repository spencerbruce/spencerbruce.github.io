desc: "I am a recent graduate from Columbia University with a BS in Computer Science on the Vision and Graphics track. 
I had a bunch of fun exploring other classes, too, like ** and ** and I found myself completing a Sociology minor, too!
I love to learn and help others learn, and my interests include sustainability, crafting, baking, Thai food, reading, and running. 
Here on my website you can find a few of my recent projects, so please have a look around and drop me a line if you'd like to collaborate!"
