thumbnail_alt: "A gif of the interaction with a parallel coordinate diagram. Each column represents one metric of data for each state, and the column can be rearranged by clicking and dragging on the column title. This redistributes the parallel coordinate chart accordingly. Hovering over a line (state) reveals a tooltip with that state's selected demographic and COVID-19 information."
